# Project structure

**Back**
We plan to have python scripts with SQL database packed into docker and hosted on AWS.

**Front**
We plan to create simple website using flask or django

# Engine

We can seperate project maturity on two phases

## Initial phase

In this phase we plan to use unsupervised learning algorithm combined with reinforcement learning.
Cause of this approach is simple - we don't have labels inputed from users.

## End phase

In this phase we plan to use supervised learning algorithms for improvement in performance. 

# Used APIs

In this project we use two main apis
* OMDb API
    * https://www.omdbapi.com/
* TMDB API
